  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "GUROBI" with any

  Add the installation prefix of "GUROBI" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "GUROBI_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "GUROBI"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
