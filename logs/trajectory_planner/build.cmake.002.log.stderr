[31m[1mCMake Error[0m at /home/chinmay/motion_planning/TrajectoryPlannerUnknownEnvironment/src/trajectoryplanner/trajectory_planner/CMakeLists.txt:21 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindGUROBI.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "GUROBI", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "GUROBI" with any
  of the following names:

    GUROBIConfig.cmake
    gurobi-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "GUROBI" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "GUROBI_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "GUROBI"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
